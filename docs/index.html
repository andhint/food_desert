        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_desert">Food deserts</a> are areas where quality, affordable food is limited. Generally, this means a lack of supermakets or grocery stores in area. These areas generally have convenience stores in the area which have less afforadble and offer limited or no whole foods.</p>
        <p>The goal of our project was to display food deserts on a street by street basis. Food deserts have <a href="http://americannutritionassociation.org/newsletter/usda-defines-food-deserts">been mapped out by the USDA before,</a>  but only a county level. We believed that it was possible to view this on a much more granular level. There is no official definition of a food desert so we tried keep our definition as simple as possible. We divided the city into a number of small squares and determined how many options were within one mile of each square.</p>

          <p>
            We sourced our data from Open Street Maps (OSM). OSM has an API were all supermarkets/grocery stores/convenience store locations could be sourced. Since we're using OSM this same map can be replicated for any city by just changing the bounds when searching for stores. We used a dataset from Buffalo Open Data to trim the dataset to just Buffalo's boundaries for aesthetic purposes.
